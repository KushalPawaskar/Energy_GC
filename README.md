Running blockchain.js gives the user three options:
1. Enter data into the blockchain
2. Obtain data from the blockchain
3. Exit



For running the program, following are required:
1. Node JS
2. npm

Also some libraries are required.
On running the code, you may get error if these libraries aren't installed.
To install a particular library _x_, run `npm install x`

[This program only includes blockchain part of the solution. 
Rest of the solution did not get completed in time.]
